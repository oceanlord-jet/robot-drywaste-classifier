This project presents an automated garbage classification system utilizing a Neo robotic arm integrated with a high-resolution camera to identify, classify, and sort waste items into designated containers for paper, plastic, and metal. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques, specifically EfficientNetB0 for object classification and YOLOv8 for multi-object detection. The integration of these technologies enables real-time, accurate sorting operations. Comprehensive testing reveals strong system reliability and sorting precision, making a substantial contribution to efficient, scalable, and environmentally sustainable waste management solutions.
